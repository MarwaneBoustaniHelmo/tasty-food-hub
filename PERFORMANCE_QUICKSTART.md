## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Vite Config ([vite.config.ts](../vite.config.ts))
```typescript
✓ Terser minification (removes console.log)
✓ Code splitting (React, UI, Query separate)
✓ CSS code splitting
✓ Asset inlining (<4KB)
✓ Cache-friendly filenames
```

### 2. .htaccess ([dist/.htaccess](../dist/.htaccess))
```apache
✓ Cache: 1 year for CSS/JS/images
✓ GZIP compression
✓ Automatic WebP serving
✓ HTTPS redirect
✓ Security headers
```

### 3. ChatBot ([src/App.tsx](../src/App.tsx))
```typescript
✓ Lazy loaded with React.lazy()
✓ Wrapped in <Suspense>
✓ -9.41 KB from initial bundle
```

### 4. Images
```
✓ OptimizedImage component created
⚠️ Need to convert to WebP (manual step)
```
